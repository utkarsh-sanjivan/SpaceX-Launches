## About
This is a browsing application for all the launches done by SpaceX. Initially it loads all the launches by the SpaceX but there is also an option to filter the list to find the desired launch. Basically there are three launches that are provided here based on the year of launch, whether the launch was successful or not and whether the launding was successful or not. All these filters can also be used in conjunction.
